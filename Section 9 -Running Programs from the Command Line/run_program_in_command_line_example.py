# shebang line

#! python3

print('Hello World!')


# To recap:
# - The shebang line tells your computer that you want to run the script using Python 3
# - On Windows, you can bring up the Run dialog by pressing Win + R
# - A batch file can save you a lot of typing by running multiple commands.
# - The batch files you'll make will look like this:
#     @py C:\Users\Alan\'folder name'\'python file name.py %*
#     @pause
# - You'll need to add the 'folder name' folder to the PATH environment variable first
# - Command-line arguments can be read in the sys.argv lists.
